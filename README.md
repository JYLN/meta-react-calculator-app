# Meta React Calculator App

This is my submission for the Meta React calculator app project hat is the end of the `React Basics` course. The grading criteria/project requirements is as follows:

## Calculator functionality

When interacting with the calculator app in the UGL or VS Code:

- Did each button have a function?
- Did each button contain the required mathematical operator?
- Did each calculation provide the correct result as its output?
- Can you suggest any improvements for the calculator app?

## Other Notes

I took the liberty to overhaul the styles as the example was rather plain. I based by color scheme on the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/contribute)
